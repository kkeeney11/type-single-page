            <h1>History of the font</h1>
                <p>
                     </p> Frances is a display font created by Phaedra Charles and Flavia Zimbardi in 2020. Fraunces has characters in Latin and Vietnamese along with English. The font has a total of 624 characters and 698 glyphs. The font is similar to “Old Style” fonts with softer serifs like Windsor, Cooper and Souvenir. The four axis’s that Frances have are Softness, Weight, Optical size, and Wonk. The Softness refers to the roundness in certain places. It adds contrast to the “Sharp” areas of the design space. Optical sizing its similar to the Softness axis, in regards to how it controls the thickness and thinness of the lines. It also factors in additional changes depending on the size of the font. At smaller sizes, the letter-spacing opens up, x-height increases, and contrast decreases to allow for easier reading. Wonk refers to the “lean” of the h, n, and m glyphs which is a characteristic borrowed from the font Windsor. In addition to the leaning characters, the Italic style contains flagged characters with ball terminals. However at a smaller size the “wonk” with switch off for easier readability.
